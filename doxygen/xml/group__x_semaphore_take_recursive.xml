For some reason due to the nature of the code further calls to 
xSemaphoreTakeRecursive() are made on the same mutex.  In real
code these would not be just sequential calls as this would make
no sense.  Instead the calls are likely to be buried inside
a more complex call structure.
            xSemaphoreTakeRecursive( xMutex, ( portTickType ) 10 );
            xSemaphoreTakeRecursive( xMutex, ( portTickType ) 10 );</preformatted></para><para><preformatted>The mutex has now been &apos;taken&apos; three times, so will not be 
available to another task until it has also been given back
three times.  Again it is unlikely that real code would have
these calls sequentially, but instead buried in a more complex
call structure.  This is just for illustrative purposes.
            xSemaphoreGiveRecursive( xMutex );
			xSemaphoreGiveRecursive( xMutex );
			xSemaphoreGiveRecursive( xMutex );</preformatted></para><para><preformatted>Now the mutex can be taken by other tasks.

        else
        {
We could not obtain the mutex and can therefore not access
the shared resource safely.
